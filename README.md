📄 Personal Webpage Project
This project is part of the HTML & CSS curriculum and serves as a hands-on opportunity to apply everything learned so far. It focuses heavily on CSS styling, selectors, box model properties, and how browsers interpret HTML and CSS to render web pages.

📚 Resources Used
During the course of this project, the following resources were consulted and applied:

Learn to Code HTML & CSS (up to “Creating Lists”)

MDN Web Docs - CSS

Inline Styles in HTML

CSS Specificity Guide

CSS SpeciFishity

Figma design file https://www.figma.com/design/dyYL6Ku4WG7vsdpwvlcJZC/Homepage?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=8lDGlQXKU4K3vXxk-0

Fonts used:

Source Sans Pro

Spin Cycle OT

W3C Validator for compliance checking

🎯 Learning Objectives
By completing this project, I am now able to confidently:

Explain what CSS is and how it works

Add style to HTML elements using inline, internal, and external CSS

Use classes and selectors to target specific elements

Calculate CSS specificity and understand how it resolves styling conflicts

Describe the CSS box model and how padding, borders, and margins interact

Understand how browsers parse and render web pages from HTML and CSS

🛠️ Project Requirements
✅ All files end with a newline

✅ Only vanilla HTML and CSS used (no external libraries or frameworks)

✅ Project validated through W3C Validator

✅ All styles implemented based on the provided Figma design

✅ Fonts and images manually added to replicate design accurately

🖼️ Design Implementation
This project replicates the layout and styling from a Figma design file, which includes sections like:

Header with logo and navigation

Hero section with call to action

Quote section using semantic tags

Footer with icons and social media links

All layout and design decisions were made to closely follow the Figma file’s structure and aesthetics. Minor rounding was done where float values were provided in design specs.

🔍 Additional Notes
This project helped reinforce real-world usage of CSS properties like flex, position, z-index, and box-sizing.

Specificity conflicts were handled by carefully structuring CSS selectors and keeping the stylesheet organized.

No JavaScript was used, in line with project requirements.
